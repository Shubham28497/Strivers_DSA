// Input: a[] = [-5, 3, 6, 12, 15], b[] = [-12, -10, -6, -3, 4, 10]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The merged array is [-12, -10, -6, -5 , -3, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 15]. So the median of the merged array is 3.

// Input: a[] = [1, 12, 15, 26, 38], b[] = [2, 13, 17, 30, 45, 60]
// Output: The median is 17.
// Explanation : The merged array is [1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45, 60]. So the median of the merged array is 17.
