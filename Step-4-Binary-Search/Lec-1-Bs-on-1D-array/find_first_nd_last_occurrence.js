// Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8

// Output: [3, 4]

// Explanation:The target is 8, and it appears in the array at indices 3 and 4, so the output is [3,4]

// Input: nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 6

// Output: [-1, -1]

// Expalantion: The target is 6, which is not present in the array. Therefore, the output is [-1, -1].
