// Examples:
// Input: nums = [0, 1, 4, 0, 5, 2]
// Output: [1, 4, 5, 2, 0, 0]
// Explanation: Both the zeroes are moved to the end and the order of the other elements stay the same
// Input: nums = [0, 0, 0, 1, 3, -2]
// Output: [1, 3, -2, 0, 0, 0]
// Explanation: All 3 zeroes are moved to the end and the order of the other elements stay the same
