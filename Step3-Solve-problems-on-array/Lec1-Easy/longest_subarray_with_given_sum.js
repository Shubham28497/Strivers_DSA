// Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 7, 1, 9],  k=15
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest sub-array with a sum equal to 15 is [5, 2, 7, 1], which has a length of 4. This sub-array starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, and the sum of its elements 
// (5 + 2 + 7 + 1) equals 15. Therefore, the length of this sub-array is 4.
