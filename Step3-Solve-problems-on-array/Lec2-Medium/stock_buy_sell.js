// Given an array arr of n integers, where arr[i] represents price of the stock on the 
// ith day. Determine the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling the stock at most once. 
// The stock should be purchased before selling it, and both actions cannot occur on the same day.
// Examples:
// Input: arr = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: Buy on day 3 (price = 5) and sell on day 5 (price = 11), profit = 11 - 5 = 6.
// Input: arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: In this case, no transactions are made. Therefore, the maximum profit remains 0.
