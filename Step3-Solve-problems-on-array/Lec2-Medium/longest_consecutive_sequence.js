// Examples:
// Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], 
// which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order
//  of the elements in the array.
// Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
// Output: 9
// Explanation: The longest sequence of consecutive elements in
//  the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9.
